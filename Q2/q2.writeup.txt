Thetas are as follows

theta0 = -2.6205
theta1 = 0.7604
theta2 = 1.1719

formula for hessian = sum over 1 to m(-x(i,j)*x(i,k)*(g)*(1-g))

where x(i,j) -> jth feature of ith example
and g is the sigmoid of theta transpose X

gradient = 	x(i)*(y(1-g) + g(1-y))

the boundary is plotted by equation theta transpose * x = 0

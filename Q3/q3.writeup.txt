value of theta is as follows

theta0 = 0.3277
theta1 = 0.1753

locally weighted linear regression is implemented for 4 values of tau = [0.1 0.3 2 10]

tau = 0.8 works the best
 
when tau is too smaller the algorithm tries to fit very closely which can lead to overfitting
when tau is too large the algorithm does not try very hard to fit which can lead to underfitting.

theta = inverse(transpose(X)*W*X)*trnspose(X)*W*Y

where W is the weight matrix
